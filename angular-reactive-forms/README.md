# AngularReactiveForms

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of Angular Reactive Forms, showcasing the key features and functionality of this robust form-handling approach in Angular.

## Project Description
This example includes a form that allows users to create, read, edit, and delete user profiles. While the form does not persist data to a database, it utilizes local storage to mimic database functionality, enabling the simulation of CRUD operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
* Form Construction: The form should be built using Angular Reactive Forms.
* User Data: The form should collect the following user information:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Address
* Validation: All fields must include required validation to ensure no fields are left empty.
* Display: User profiles will be displayed on the right side of the form.
* Form Layout: The form will be displayed on the left-hand side of the page.
* Edit Functionality: Users will be able to edit existing profiles.
* Delete Functionality: Users will be able to delete user profiles.
