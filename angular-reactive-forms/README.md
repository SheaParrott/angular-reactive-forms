# AngularReactiveForms

## Overview
This project is a simple demonstration of Angular Reactive Forms, designed to showcase the key features and functionality of this powerful form-handling approach in Angular.

## Project Description
For this example, Iâ€™ve created a form that allows users to input their profile information. While the form does not persist data to a database, it does store the data in the application's state.

## Acceptance Criteria
 * Form Construction: The form should be built using Angular Reactive Forms.
 * User Data: The form should collect the following user information:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Address
 * Validation: All fields must include required validation to ensure that no fields are left empty.
